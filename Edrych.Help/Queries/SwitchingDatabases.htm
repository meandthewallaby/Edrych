<h1>Switching Databases</h1>
For many database servers, the current database context is of paramount importance. So, Edrych gives you
a way to switch between active databases within the query quickly and without issue. To access the menu
of available databases, either hit the database drop down with your mouse, or use Ctrl+U. Then, select the
database you want with the mouse or the keyboard. If using the keyboard, Edrych will direct your focus
back to the query once you hit the Enter key.
