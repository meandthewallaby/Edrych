<h1>Running a Query</h1>
Running a query is done with the help of the beloved F5 button. Once you hit F5, Edrych will take the text in the query area that's selected.
If no text is selected, then Edrych will take all the text in the query area. With that text, Edrych will run it against the connected
server and database and then spit out the results in the Results window below the query area.
<br><br>
Do note that a query has to be connected to a server with a database selected to work!
