<h1>Interserver Queries</h1>
The most powerful part of Edrych is the ability to query two different databases from the same
query. While Edrych is fairly limited in its ability to run interserver queries, you can still
do quite a lot with it to compare data between two places. As we soldier on, support should
only improve.
<h2>Syntax</h2>
The syntax is fairly simple for interserver queries. Ostensibly it goes:
<br><br>
<code>
insert into BaseTable (cols)<br>
[servername].[databasename]<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;select<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cols<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;table<br> 
};
</code><br><br>
You can also join two datasets with an inner join or a left join, only. Note that you cannot use a <code>where</code> or an <code>order by</code> clause with the <code>select</code>. You can put them in your subqueries, though.
<br><br>
<code>
select a.Col1, a.Col2, b.Col1, b.Col2
from 
(select * from BaseTable) a
inner join ([servername].[databasename] { select * from RemoteTable }) b on
	a.col = b.col
</code>
<h2>Notes</h2>
Ensure that the base table you're inserting into is created!
<br><br>
Note that the join condition is currently limited at 1 column equals another column. Also, the table aliases can be anything you'd like.
<br><br>
Beware doing this for large tables--all the processing is within Edrych, so network and your local
machine constraints will apply.
