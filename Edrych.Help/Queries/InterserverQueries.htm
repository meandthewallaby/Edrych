<h1>Interserver Queries</h1>
The most powerful part of Edrych is the ability to query two different databases from the same
query. While Edrych is fairly limited in its ability to run interserver queries, you can still
do quite a lot with it to compare data between two places. As we soldier on, support should
only improve.
<h2>Syntax</h2>
The syntax is fairly simple for interserver queries. Ostensibly it goes:
<br><br>
<code>
insert into BaseTable (cols)<br>
[servername].[databasename]<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;select<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cols<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;table<br> 
};
</code>
<h2>Notes</h2>
Ensure that the base table you're inserting into is created!
<br><br>
Coming soon: Ability to join two tables without doing the insert.
<br><br>
Beware doing this for large tables--all the processing is within Edrych, so network and your local
machine constraints will apply.
