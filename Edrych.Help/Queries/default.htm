<h1>Queries</h1>
The most real estate of Edrych is taken up by the beloved query window. This is where it all comes together--where you can run free-range queries
against eagerly awaiting databases and get results instantly. Not only can you get results from select queries, but you also get confirmation
from data alteration operations through the Messages tab.
<br><br>
But what makes Edrych special is the ability to use <a href="Interserver Queries/">Interserver Queries</a>, or queries between two different
database servers, <i>without the need for linked servers</i>. Edrych handles it all for you, but you've got to use some special syntax
to get it to work properly.
<br><br>
Make sure you read about <a href="RunningQuery.htm">Running a Query</a> so you know what query is running when! And read <a href="SwitchingDatabases.htm">Switching Databases</a>, too, so you know how to change your active connection!
