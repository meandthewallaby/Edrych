<h1>Welcome to Edrych</h1>
Edrych is a data explorer for a variety of database servers. When dealing with multiple different database servers, one typically has to
use a different tool for each server. Now, you can browse all you want on Edrych, while executing queries that can actually 
<i>talk between servers</i>! No more need for setting up clunky linked servers, because Edrych handles it all for you!

<h2>Understanding Edrych</h2>
There are a couple of components to Edrych that you should learn how to navigate to provide for the best experience. When you first
open up Edrych, you get prompted by the Connection Dialog. Once you connect to a server (or cancel out), you'll see the main window:

<br><br>
This screenshot shows after you've opened up a Query, but you can easily find that by going to File->New, or clicking the New button 
(<img src="/Images/NewIcon.bmp" border="0" />).
<br><br>
On the left is the <a href="/Server Browser/default.htm">Server Browser</a>, which allows you to easily look through a database server that you've connected to and discover
its structure. Use this to navigate through the server and help you formulate your queries.
<br><br>
On the right is the <a href="/Queries/default.htm">Query Window</a>, which allows you to run queries against the database servers. It's entirely free-form, so use
caution! The database server will do whatever you tell it to do with your credentials!
