<h1>Navigating the Server Browser</h1>
Each database server is laid out exactly the same way in the Server Browser. This provides a
consistent experience for you to navigate through the databases. Your interaction with the
Server Browser is entirely based on the current selected item. Edrych changes your context for 
new queries and the like entirely based on the selected node.

<h2>The Levels</h2>
The Server Browser uses four levels: <b>Server</b>, <b>Database</b>, <b>Tables/Views</b>, and <b>Columns</b>. 
The <b>Database</b> and <b>Tables/Views</b> are separated by a folder level, which groups <b>Tables</b>
and <b>Views</b> separately.

<h2>Context Menu</h2>
You can right-click on a node in the tree to bring up the context menu. From here, you can take actions on a
specific node in the tree. Currently, you can perform the following actions:

<h3>New Query</h3>
Clicking New Query on a node will open up a new query window connected to the server the node is under,
using the parent database of the node (if you click on the server, it will use the default).

<h3>Refresh</h3>
Clicking the Refresh button on a node will cause it to collapse the node and refresh the children information
of that node. This is greatly useful when using Edrych to alter the structures, and then seeing the results
of your changes immediately.
