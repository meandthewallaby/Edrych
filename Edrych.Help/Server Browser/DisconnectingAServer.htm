<h1>Disconnecting a Server</h1>
You can easily remove a server from the Server Browser by simply disconnecting from it. Firstly, you need to
select an item in the tree at or under the server you want to disconnect. Once a node is selected, 
the disconnect options will become enabled, and you can remove the server.
<br><br>
The first is to disconnect through the File menu. Simply go to File-->Disconnect, and it will remove
the server from the list:
