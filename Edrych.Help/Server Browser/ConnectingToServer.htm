<h1>Connecting to a Server</h1>
When first opening Edrych, the Connection Dialog will pop up to instantiate your session connected
to the database server of your choice. In order to connect to different servers, there are two ways
you can connect to another server.
<br><br>
The first is to connect through the File menu. Simply go to File-->Connect, and it will pop up the
Connection Dialog for you to add a server:
